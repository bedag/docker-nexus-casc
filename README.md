This Docker image extends the [Sonatype Nexus3 Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3) with the Nexus plugin [CASC](https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/nexus-casc-plugin). This plugin allows to configure nexus with a declartive configuration file, which makes nexus more controllable for kubernetes deployments.

Feel free the create a new Issue if you have any problems with the image.

## Configuration

All the configuration are supported from the original images:

The Default configuration being used can be found [here](./nexus_default.yml). Mount your own Configuration under `/opt/nexus.yml`. You can also change the CASC Coonfig location via `NEXUS_CASC_CONFIG` environment variable.
